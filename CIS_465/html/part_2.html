<title> Part 2 </title>
<p>After implementing the key frame selection algorithm, I was able to see the video playing in small clips that highlight the key events in the sample video. These include the events in the video such as passing the basketball or shooting the basketball. The 29 batch video is the one that provided the best result as it did show the most events and lasts a total of about 5 seconds with 151 frames.  The 145 batch did provide a longer video of 12 seconds but it seemed that the beginning and end of the video were omitted from the output. </p>
